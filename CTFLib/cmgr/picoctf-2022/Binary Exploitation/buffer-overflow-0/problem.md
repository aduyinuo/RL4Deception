## Description

Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is
available {{url_for("vuln", "here")}}. You can view source
{{url_for("vuln.c", "here")}}.

## Details

Connect using:

`nc {{server("overflow")}} {{port("overflow")}}`

## Hints
- How can you trigger the flag to print?
- If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters.
  Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
- Run `man gets` and read the BUGS section. How many characters can the program
  really read?

## Learning Objective

Understanding buffer overflow, gets() unbounded read and strcpy().
